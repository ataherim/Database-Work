ps wuax | grep mongo
You should see something that looks like this

User           31936   0.5 0.4 2719784 35624   ?? S     7:34pm   0:09.98 mongod
User           31945   0.0 0.0 2423368   184 s000 R+   8:24pm   0:00.00 grep mongo
Now enter the kill command for the mongod instance (31936 in this case):
